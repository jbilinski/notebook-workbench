## Unique Details
Fine detail in crafting scroll, pegbox, f-holes. Very light weight and thin plates. Notched drop saddle.
This was a well crafted instrument. it has had significant, professional, work done over the years; It is certainly fragile due to age and use. I wouldn't expect it to hold up as well as other student violins to stress and seasons.

## Target Usage
Student loaner. Recommended for experienced, responsible students.

## Current Condition

Delicate, with some wear and repairs. It is playable but should be handled with care. It has a good sound but needs new stings (mostly bass side) to balance sound.

**Status:** {{ page.status }}

## Recommendations

- Strings: Replace with new strings, especially on the bass side, to improve sound balance.
- Regular maintenance: Due to its age and delicate condition, regular check-ups by a luthier are recommended to ensure it remains playable and to address any emerging issues promptly.
- Bridge: bridge is flatter on higher strings. a new bridge with a standard curve would help with (loaner) playability.
