## Initial Condition
 - Dirty with layers of oil and rosin. ![alt text](../images/PXL_20241011_234437225.jpg) 
 - Detached fingerboard -- maybe due to flex of very thin neck? 
 - Stress cracks in bottom bout ribs -- none appear open
 - Angled grooves across top -- looks like maybe damage that was repaired long ago
 - Pegs are short and rough with multiple winding holes ![alt text](../images/PXL_20241011_234525389.jpg)
 - Lower-treble Top plate corner chipped to rib and bee sting ![alt text](../images/PXL_20241011_234729555.jpg)
 - Missing purfling in spots on back ![alt text](../images/PXL_20241011_234628611.jpg) 
 - Semi-Opaque varnish layer dissolved in oil/rosin under high-wear areas
 - Bridge is mildly flat (non-standard) ![alt text](../images/PXL_20241011_235238814.jpg)

## Work Performed

- [x] cleaning (cotton cloth lightly moist with water)
- [x] Several high wear areas with oil build-up did not hold varnish.

- [x] cleaned fingerboard light plaining -- one minor groove still under A, beyond playable position
- [x] Used 192 hide glue to completely seal top and bottom plates and clamped
- [x] Repaired broken plate corners ![alt text](../images/PXL_20250113_071232029.jpg)
- [x] Added ground coat and several golden amber (translucent) varnish layers to exposed areas ![alt text](../images/PXL_20250113_070854226.jpg) ![alt text](../images/PXL_20250113_071312888.jpg)
- [x] After base layers added some opaque acrylic to make top finish look more consistent (left area on ribs translucent) ![alt text](../images/PXL_20250113_071201081.jpg)
- [x] Set prepared fingerboard with high GS hide glue, clamped
- [x] Spot varnished joints for protection ![alt text](../images/PXL_20250113_070927358.jpg)
- [x] Varnished, polished, top a few more times for durability and look
- [x] Cut and fitted new rosewood pegs (will send original ebony back in case) ![alt text](../images/PXL_20250113_070909743.jpg)
- [x] Brought E lower on original bridge and added parchment
- [x] Restring (reused 3 old that were not physically damaged), A needed sleeve to prevent cut
- [x] Allowed varnish to cure under UV light for a few weeks
