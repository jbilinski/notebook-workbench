**Date**: {{ page.date }}
**Instrument ID**: [[violin-11]]
**Status Change**: {{ page.status-change }}

## Initial Condition
 - Dirty with layers of oil and rosin.
 - Detached fingerboard -- maybe due to flex of very thin neck?
 - Stress cracks in bottom bout ribs -- none appear open
 - Angled grooves across top -- looks like maybe damage that was repaired long ago
 - Pegs are short and rough with multiple winding holes
 - Lower-treble Top plate corner chipped to rib and bee sting
 - Missing purfling in spots on back
 - Semi-Opaque varnish layer dissolved in oil/rosin under high-wear areas
 - Bridge is mildly flat (non-standard)
 - Many open joints on top and bottom
 - Metal horizontal pin in top plate (to prevent splintering?)

## Work Performed

- [x] cleaning (cotton cloth lightly moist with water)
- [x] Several high wear areas with oil build-up did not hold varnish. Varnish was mostly intact in areas darkened by rosin/dirt
- [x] cleaned fingerboard light plaining -- one minor groove still under A, beyond playable position
- [x] Used 192 hide glue to completely seal top and bottom plates and clamped
- [x] Added ground coat and several golden amber (translucent) varnish layers to exposed areas
- [x] After base layers added some opaque acrylic to make top finish look more consistent (left area on ribs translucent)
- [x] Set prepared fingerboard with high GS hide glue, clamped
- [x] Spot varnished joints for protection
- [x] Varnished, polished, top a few more times for durability and look
- [x] Cut and fitted new rosewood pegs (will send original ebony back in case)
- [x] Brought E lower on original bridge and added parchment
- [x] Restring (reused 3 old that were not physically damaged), A needed sleeve to prevent cut
- [x] Allowed varnish to cure under UV light for a few weeks

## Parts/Materials Used
- 192gs hide glue
- 251gs hot hide glue (fingerboard)
- Golden amber violin oil varnish
- parchment for bridge
- gelatin and ground coat
- rosewood pegs (new)
- 2000g mesh sandpaper for polishing
- hindersol hindersine polish
- hinderpaste peg compound
