To address the main issue, all of the pegs must be slightly shaved to fit properly.

Other things I noted:
 - Crack in right upper bout top plate ![open joint](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1UYqWZz3REJ5N45cRZvrbm7FVVxLIcyGB){: width="300px"}
 - Opening between TP and rib just left of the crack
 - Bridge is warped
 - A String has broken winding
 - Odd shape of nut (may be related to string damage)
 - Minor body scrapes and corner chips with exposed spruce

My initial thoughts about other issues: 
 - I'll cover the top plate crack with varnish (temporary fix)
 - I'll put a small amount of hide glue on the surface of the open joint and wipe away excess. (temporary fix) 
 - I'm concerned that the top plate crack will grow if I attempt to separate the body just enough to properly glue the open area
 - I'll cut a new bridge
 - Replace strings (at least start with "A")
 - I'm not going to mess with the odd-shaped nut -- it seems like it has ok dimensions relative to the fingerboard and pegbox. I'll put a little graphite under the strings to prevent binding
 - I'll clean up top plate, varnish fill with a detail brush, and give a light polish
